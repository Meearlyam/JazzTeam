## Test task for the JazzTeam internship

This application allows you to convert large numbers (both positive and negative) into their string representation. 
The model directory contains converter classes that are used to translate numbers to strings and abstract class all
converters are inherited from. There is TestData.xls file in the resource directory to perform DDT. So, you can perform
testing in the following ways:
* Edit ConverterControllerTest.java file by adding new @Test-s (if you are a developer or tester);"
* Edit TestData.xls file in MicrosoftExcel (otherwise);

To run application choose ConverterController class in your "Run/Debug configurations". In case you want to run 
tests you need to choose the ConverterControllerTest.
<br><br>You can find documentation for all classes of this application in the [javadoc](https://github.com/Meearlyam/JazzTeam/tree/master/javadoc/) directory.
<br><br>Thank you for your attention :)
